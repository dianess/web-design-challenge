# web-design-challenge

For this challenge, I used graphs from my "Stocking Presidents" project to create a website with links to several pages. My code is in HTML and CSS using Bootstrap, and I also used Python in Jupyter Notebook to convert my csv data file to HTML.

To view the website, click: [Stocking Presidents](https://dianess.github.io/web-design-challenge/)

Conclusion: Based on this data, we failed to reject the null-hypothesis, which was: If the President of the United States does not influence the stock market, we would expect the frequency of positive and negative close days, measured from election to inauguration and by total term of each President, to be equal to the market historical average.
